# In this weeks online lectures, we covered design patterns that are used commonly in game programming. Design patterns are methods to structure code that make it clean to read and effecient.

# Specifically, we covered singletons, and the factory pattern.

# Signletons are instnaces of a class that exist over a projects lifespan. Only one singleton can exist of a given class, and they should not be cyclicly dependent.

# Factories are generic classes that are used to create instances of objects. What a factory creates is defined by the class that implements it. For example, a factory could spawn either a goblin or an orc enemy. They should not care about the type of the object being created, since factories are generic.
